This the basic structure of a ML workflow (Project) :

We have to keep this structure in mind beacause it will help us understand the key components of the Databricks machine learning:
### Databricks machine learning :
Provides an integrated machine learning environment that helps you simplify and standardize your ML development process like : 
- Train a model manually/AutoML
- Track training prams and model's perf using MLflow
- Share , manage and serve models using model registry and Databricks model serving 
- Feature store can be useful to develop and share feature, track upstream and downstream feature lineage, and serve feature values online.
