Here I share all the knowledge that I acquired during my journey to reach the pinical of MLOps and ML engineering.

![MLOps Map](summary.png)

You can get use of these courses by using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) it is a private and flexible noteâ€‘taking app .

Within this repository you can find different technologies I use to set up my Data_science/Machine_learning pipelines from POC to productions.

I am updating this everytime i find intersting things on the web !

Enjoy :D
