Is when we use Machine learning Neural Networks to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos

### Computer vision deep learning algorithms
* Convolutional neural networks (CNN) : Image and video recognition
	* Inspired after how human eyes actually process information and send it to brain to be processed 
* Recurrent neural network (RNN) : Handwriting recognition or speech recognition 

### Types of computer vision
* Image classification
* Object detection
* Semantic segmentation
* Image analysis
* Optical character recognition

### Azure's computer vision service offering
* Computer vision : analyze images and video, and extract description, tags, objects and text.
* Custom vision :  custom image classification and object detection models using your own images
* Face : Detect and identify people and emotions in images.
* Form Recognizer : Translate scanned documents into key/value or tabular editable data
