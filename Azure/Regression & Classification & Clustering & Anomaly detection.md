### Regression
Regression is a process to find a function to correlate a labeled dataset into continuous variable/number.
Different Regression algorithms use the error to predict future variables :
* Mean squared error (MSE)
* Root mean squared error (RMSE)
* Mean absolute error (MAE)

### Classification
classification is a process of finding a function to divide a labeled dataset into classes/categories
* Logistic regression
* Decision tree/random forest
* Neural Networks
Confusion matrix : Table to visualize model prediction vs ground truth . Also known as error matrix

|            | Predicted No | Predicted YES |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Actual No  | XX           | XX            |
| Actual YES | XX           | XX            |

### Clustering
Clustering is a process grouping unlabeled data based on similarities and differences.
Group data based on their similarities or differences
* K-means
* K-medoids
* Density based
* Hierarchical

### Anomaly detection

This is the process of finding outliers within a dataset called an anomaly.
Detecting when a piece of data or access patterns appear suspicious or malicious . 

Use cases for anomaly detection:
* Data  cleaning 
* Intrusion detection
* Fraud detection
* Systems health monitoring
* Event detection in sensor networks
* Ecosystem disturbances
* Detection of critical and cascading flaws
