#### Supervised Learning : 
that has been labeled for training 
	Task-driven - Make a prediction
	Classification , Regression

#### Unsupervised Learning : 
Data has not been labeled the ML model need to do it's own labeling
	Data-driven - Recognize a structure or pattern
	Clustering, Dimensionality reduction (PCA) , Association

#### Reinforcement Learning : 
The is no data, there is an environment and an ML model generates data any many attempt to reach a goal
	Decision-driven - 
	Game AI, Learning tasks , Robot navigation
