Made to mimic the human brain. 
Connection between neuron is weighted 
A Neural network that has 3 or more hidden layers is considered deep learning (Input layer, Hidden layer, Output layer)
* Feed forward neural network: NN where connections between nodes do not for a cycle (always move forward)
* Backpropagation: Move backwards through the NN adjusting it's weights to improve outcome on the next iteration (Learning)
* Loss function :  A function the aims to compare the ground truth to the prediction to determine the error rate
* Activation function: An algorithm applied to hidden layer node that effects the connected output eg : ReLu (It impact how the weighting/learning works)
* Dense: When the next layer increase the amount of nodes
* Sparse :  When the next layer decreases the amount of nodes
